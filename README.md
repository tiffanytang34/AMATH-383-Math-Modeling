# AMATH-383-Math-Modeling
In the final paper of this course, my team focused on the math modeling on the spread of COVID-19 based on the susceptible-infected-removed model (SIR). We proposed two models: first infection model, in which recovered group would not get infection again, and second infection model, which treats recovered group of population as part of the susceptible group. We simulated the spread of CIVID-19 with the differential recersive method in Matlab. 
The simulation of second infection model reflected the actual stats in China.
